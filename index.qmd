You must have the following:

- [ ] RStudio
- [ ] GitHub account

::: {.callout-note}
This website's directory is `quarto-tutorial`. The directory in the images is `quarto_web_tutorial`, which I deleted because I prefer dashes over underscores in URLs.

# Create a R project

Actions: File > New Project > New Directory > Quarto Website

1. **Directory name** 
    i) If this website is for . . .
         A.  yourself: `your-github-username.github.io`
         B.  class: `your-class-name`
2. Create project as **subdirectory**
    i) Where do you want to place this project? It should be somewhere easy to find, such as on your desktop.
    ii) I'll be creating more version-controlled projects, so I placed this directory (`quarto-tutorial`) inside a "github" folder, which is located inside my Box drive. Therefore, this directory's file path is the following:
  
```{r eval=FALSE}
├── Box-Box
  ├── github
    ├── quarto-tutorial
```

3. Engine: **Knitr**
4. Select **Create a git repository**
5. Select **Use renv with this project**
